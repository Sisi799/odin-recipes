        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>What I had to do to squeeze this recipe from my neighbor...but it's worth it. This is a scrumptious version of sticky chicken.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup prepared barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.</li>
        </ol>
